## Identification tips

![general](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/post/helianthus%20annuus/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** the genre comes from the ancient Greek helios, "sun" + ánthos, "flower". Annun means for one year,  because of its an annual plant.

## Leaves

**3º Identification tip:** the leaves have a rough texture and are oval or heart-shaped. The leaves are alternating and have hair. The top surface of the leaves is opaque green and covered with short, stiff hair, giving a sandpaper feel. Petioles are light green to reddish-green and covered with short, stiff hair; the top surface of each petiole is channeled.

## Flowers

**5º Identification tip:** the flowers are large yellow and a central disc red-brown. Flowers bloom between July and September.
