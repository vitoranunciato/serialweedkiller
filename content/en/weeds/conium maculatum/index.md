## Identification tips

![geral](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/post/conium%20maculatum/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** the name of the genus  *Conium*  comes from the Greek "hemlock". This may be related to  konas  (which means spinning), in reference to vertigo, one of the symptoms of plant ingestion. *maculatum*  comes from Latin and has a relationship with spotting or stained, a  feature that greatly facilitates the identification of the species is its stained stem.
