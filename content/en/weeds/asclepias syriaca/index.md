## Identification tips

![geral](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/weeds/asclepias%20syriaca/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** the name of the genus, Asclepias, celebrates 
Asklepios, the Greek god of medicine. Syriaca, means "from Syria" about Linnaeus' mistaken belief that this species originated from Syria.
