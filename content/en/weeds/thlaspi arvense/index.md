## Identification tips

![geral](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/weeds/thlaspi%20arvense/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** This mustard family takes a hard time inventing a tip on how to decorate the name, but the genre comes from the Greek thlaein, "crush", "flattened" which is the characteristic of the fruits of this species and the species comes from Latin and means from the field.

## Plant shape

**2º Identification tip:** the plant has its development in the shape of a rosette, can have only one stem or multiple, does not have hair on the stems and leaves.

## Leaves

**3º Identification tip:** as well as almost all plants of the family of mustard leaves despite the character of the family, it is not a good parameter to identify because it has different forms and can present petiole when in a rosette and present sessile leaves (coming straight from the stem).

## Stem

**4º Identification tip:** the main one leaves the center of the rosette, and from it can present new stems and/or new stems appear from the lateral buds of the rosette. The stems have ribs highlighted around it, forming as if they were stripes that stand out on the stem.

## Pod
**6º Identification tip:** pods are the main characteristic for identification, they give the name to the gene, are flattened. Initially, it has a green heart shape, then have pale wing shape.

## Seeds
**7º Identification tip:** the seeds are certainly the characteristic that allows rapid identification of the species since the seeds have a digital pattern in it.

**this plant has a very astringent aroma (nothing pleasant), garlic armoa, this aroma can be highlighted when kneaded leaves and stem, helping in identifying it.**
