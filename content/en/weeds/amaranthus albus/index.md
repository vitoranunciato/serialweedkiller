## Identification tips

![geral](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/weeds/amaranthus%20albus/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** the name of the amaranth genus  comes from the Greek amaranths, "unbeatable", referring to the long-lasting flowers; albus  means white. Just remember who this species is "sister",  of the [Amaranthus  palmeri](https://serialweedkiller.netlify.app/weeds/amaranthus-palmeri/) so just remember the  Chuck  Norris  (unbeatable), because these days the [A. palmeri](https://serialweedkiller.netlify.app/weeds/amaranthus-palmeri/) is the  Chuck  Norris of the weeds.

## Plant shape

**2º Identification tip:** the plant as a whole has a shrub appearance, has many leaves and in the axil of the leaves are formed clusters of flowers. In winter this plant stands out from the ground and rolls with the propulsion of the wind.

## Leaves

**3º Identification tip:** the leaves are rhomboids to oval, elliptical or sparse. The color is pale green, with earlier leaves (formed on the main or secondary axis) measure up to 8 cm in length. The later leaves are smaller. The margins of the leaves are green, often wavy.

## Stem

**4º Identification tip:** the stem could be white and round and slightly wrinkled green. The stems and leaves are hairless. The lateral branches usually develop at more open angles (75 to 90º) from the central stem and curve upwards, forming a shrub.

## Flowers

**5º Identification tip:** of the axil of each leaf, a small cluster of flowers develops. Each flower is surrounded by 3 lanceolate bracts, each bracts has an elongated tip that is rigid, so the flowers are puncturing when pressed.

## Seeds

**6º Identification tip:** seeds are extremely small a single plant can produce about 92,000 fertile seeds and 58,000 sterile seeds. Seed dispersal is naturally carried out by the wind at short distances (1-3 m around the mother plant), birds or other animals, as well as through agricultural machinery. If you feel brave and confident you could try to identify the seeds [here](http://idtools.org/id/table_grape/weed-tool/key/GrapeSeedKey/Media/Html/fact_sheets/Ama-alb.html)

## Fruits
**7º Identification tip:** the fruits are small and are in the axil of the leaves.

## Seedlings - the terror of all

**8º Identification tip:** cotyledons  are  spatula shaped and the true leaves are oval, just as the true leaves the  cotyledons tend to be the smallest of the  amaranthus.
