## Identification tips

![geral](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/weeds/apocynum%20cannabinum/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** to tell you the truth I didn't like to know the origin of the name of this species, since the name of the genus comes from the Greek apókunon, apo "away"and  kúōn "dog", something like passing the dog beyond, referring to the  dogbane  (*Cionura erecta*), used to poison dogs. While the name of the species comes from the Latin cannabium meaning Hemp.
