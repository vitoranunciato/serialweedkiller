## Identification tips

![general](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/weeds/amaranthus%20powellii/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** the name of the amaranth genus comes from the Greek amaranths, "unbeatable", referring to the long-lasting flowers. Just remember who this species is "sister", from [Amaranthus  palmeri](https://serialweedkiller.netlify.com/pt/weeds/amaranthus-palmeri/) so just remember the  Chuck  Norris (unbeatable), because these days the [A. palmeri](https://serialweedkiller.netlify.com/en/weeds/amaranthus-palmeri/) is the  Chuck  Norris of the weeds. While the name of the  species  powellii  honors [John Wesley Powell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley_Powell), the famous explorer of the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon.

## Flowers

## Seeds

**6ยบ Identification tip:**it is not possible to identify the seeds among the genus amaranthus,so it is worth checking, small, black and shiny seeds. If  you have guts you can try to identify the seeds [here](http://idtools.org/id/table_grape/weed-tool/key/GrapeSeedKey/Media/Html/fact_sheets/Ama-pow.html)
