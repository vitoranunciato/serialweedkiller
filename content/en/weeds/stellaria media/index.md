## Identification tips

![general](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/post/stellaria%20media/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)


**Tip #1:** to remember the scientific name, the name of the genus comes from the Latin "Stella" meaning star, the flowers are very reminiscent of a star and the name of the species comes from the Latin "media" which means it kind of has to do with the size of the species, just remember that it is born in the middle of the crop.

## Plant shape

**2º Identification tip:** usually the plant grows in a prostrate way, and can emit roots in stem nodes. It may grow upright too, but it's less common.

## Leaves

**3º Identification tip:** the leaves are oval and opposite when they grow they can show ripples on the sides of the sheet without changing the margin of the leaf.

## Stem

**4º Identification tip:** the stems are fundamental for identification of this species, these have thin hairs in a parallel line and change direction to each node, forming as if it were a spiral along the stem. These hairs are also present in the petiole and in the gems.

## Flowers

**5º Identification tip:** the flowers are also one with identification indicative of the species, the star shape of the sepals is very characteristic, accompanied by the divided white petals.

**Although they are quite peculiar, the seeds are very small, making it difficult to observe this characteristic with the naked eye.**

## Seedlings - the terror of all

**7º Identification tip:** cotyledons are shaped like a spear, hairless. They have short stems with sparse hair. The first and next pair of leaves are oval, with small tips at the tips and have short stems with a line of hair down on both sides.
