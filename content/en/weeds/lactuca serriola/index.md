## Identification tips

![geral](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/post/lactuca%20serriola/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** Lactuca comes from Latin, lactugo, means "milk" and serriola also from Latin and means saw shape.

## Plant shape

**2º Identification tip:** this plant is annual or biennial and non-branched, except where flowering stems occur that branch into various floral branches.

## Leaves

**3º Identification tip:** the leaves are alternated (1 sheet per node), have saw shape, the leaves of the base are larger than the leaves of the stem. Leaf bases typically consist of ear-like lobes that attach to the stem. The top surface of the leaf is hairless, but there are thorns along the edge, and the central rib on the bottom surface of the leaf is covered by sharp thorns. The leaves taste like lettuce and exude a milky juice when cut or crushed.
