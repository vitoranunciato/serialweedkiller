## Identification tips

![general](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/weeds/amaranthus%20tuberculatus/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** the name of the amaranth genus comes from the Greek amaranths, "unbeatable", referring to the long-lasting flowers. Just remember who this species is "sister", from [Amaranthus  palmeri](https://serialweedkiller.netlify.com/pt/weeds/amaranthus-palmeri/) so just remember Chuck Norris (unbeatable), because these days the [A. palmeri](https://serialweedkiller.netlify.com/pt/weeds/amaranthus-palmeri/) is the Chuck Norris of the weeds. While the name of the species  tuberculatus  comes from  tūberculum  meaning  "tubercle".

## Plant shape

**2º Identification tip:** plants are variable from upright to wide, from few branches to many branches, from massive to robust. This species is the one that generates the most confusion when compared to [A. palmeri](https://serialweedkiller.netlify.com/pt/weeds/amaranthus-palmeri/).

## Leaves

**3º Identification tip:** leaves are alternating, lanceolate, ovate-lanceolate or oblong, with smooth margins and a shiny top surface. The leaves tend to be larger in the lower thirds of the plant, and become thinner as they approach the inflorescences,the leaves do not have hair. The  petiole  is not bigger than the limbo of the leaf.

## Stem

**4º Identification tip:** the stems do not have hair,they are green to reddish.

## Flowers

**5º Identification tip:** the plant is dioic possessing male and female flowers in different plants, but what differentiates from [A. palmeri](https://serialweedkiller.netlify.com/pt/weeds/amaranthus-palmeri/)is that the flowers are not prickly.

## Seeds

**6º Identification tip:** it is not possible to identify the seeds among the genus amaranthus,so it is worth checking, small, black and shiny seeds.

## Seedlings - the terror of all

**7º Identification Tip:** cotiledones are thin and spoon-shaped, as the first real leaves do not overlap cotiledones, having an oval shape.
