## Identification tips

![general](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/post/crepis%20tectorum/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** The genus Crepis derives from the Greek krepis, which means "slipper" or "sandal", possibly in reference to the shape of the fruit. The species came from the Latin tectưr: wall decorator, plasterer, painter.

## Plant shape

**2º Identification tip:** this plant is commonly confused with dandelion, being also biannual, forming rosette in the first year and forming flowers and stem in the second year. Being differentiated from dandelion by 2 characteristics that, combined, separate it from other dandelion weeds: presence of auricles in some of the leaves of the stem and the inner surface of the bracts are covered with hair, although an enlargement may be necessary to see them clearly.

## Leaves

**3º Identification tip:** leaves change shape as they "rise"" on the stem. The basal leaves form the rosette with coarse teeth, a pointed tip and short stem. The basal leaves wilt mainly as the plant matures. The lower leaves of the stem have more irregular teeth or are divided with pointed lobes, wavy edges and, most often, without stem and the upper leaves are thin and have auricle at the base of the leaf.
