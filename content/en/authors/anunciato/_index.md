In addition to Ph.D., I am also a father, husband, homebrewer and podcaster ([papoagro](https://www.papoagro.com.br/)). I believe science should be for everyone, so I try to demystify some of the widespread untruths about Brazilian agriculture, to bring more information and to facilitate the understanding of the science behind the technological advances and techniques used in agriculture, with the main focus on weed science. PS: English isn't my mother language, so if you see some grammar mistakes, please let me know.
