## Identification tips

![geral](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/weeds/ambrosia%20artemesiifolia/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** to remember the scientific name, the name of the genus comes from the Greek "food of the gods", traditionally considers the food of the gods a dessert called ambrosia and I like to think that the goddess of hunting Artemis loved this dessert, so they named this species as ambrosia armesisiifolia. And why the "folia (leaf)" at the end? Just remember that the leaf of the plant resembles a hunting arrow.

## Seeds

**6º Identification tip:** the seeds have a straw, black and moss coloring, have a peculiar characteristic looking like a small head with a small crown and a pointed hat, care must be taken not to be confused with the seed of [*Ambrosia trifida*](https://serialweedkiller.netlify.com/pt/post/ambrosia-trifida/), this one has the crown and hat much larger.

**7º Identification tip:** look for the lobed leaf (similar to lace or fern) and the cotyledons are spoon-shaped, being round different from the real leaves.
