## Identification tips

**First of all the currently under the International Plant Names Index this specie is listed as [Cynanchum laeve Pers](https://www.ipni.org/n/96315-1). So I did the joke with the name *Cynanchum laeve*.**

**Tip #1:** the more I study the etymology of plant names the more I find that the botanicals who named the plants definitely didn't like dogs, maybe they were  "cat-lovers". The name  Cynanchum in Greek translation means dog suffocating or something like that. Laeve means smooth.

## Plant shape

**2º Identification tip:** this vine is perennial, the foliage has a heart shape and exudes a sap if crushed or cut. The plant reproduces by seeds and roots.

## Stem

**4º Identification tip:** the stem is typical of vines, has no hair and usually has green coloration, and may have reddish coloration. When broken the stem releases milky sap.

## Flowers

**5º Identification tip:** the flowers are white, have pleasant aroma and pot shape. The clustering in umbrella format into a set of many flowers. A very distinct feature of these flowers is the crown they have, an appendix located between the petals and stamens.

## Seeds

**6º Identification tip:** seeds are quite characteristic of milkweed-like species.  The seed has straw coloration and white hair that's an aid in its dispersion.

## Fruits

**7º Identification tip:** the fruits are pointed, seem like an American football ball, are initially green and take the color straw and open releasing the seeds.

## Roots

**8º Identification tip:** the roots is the characteristic that brings greater difficulty in controlling this species, requiring the use of systemic herbicide to effectively control the roots. 

## Seedlings - the terror of all

**9º Identification tip:** the cotyledons are well rounded, the first pair of true leaves already follows the pattern of the plant having a heart shape.
