## Identificação tips

![general](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/weeds/ambrosia%20trifida/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** to remember the scientific name, the name of the genus comes from the Greek  ưμβροσία "food of the gods", traditionally one considers the food of the gods a dessert called ambrosia, already  trifida  comes from the Latin crossing or crossroads, due to the characteristic of leaves and knots.

## Flowers

**5º Identification tip:** the flowers are practically unique, having very peculiar characteristics, resambling to a pot of ambrosia, can easily be confused with [*Ambrosia artemissiifolia*](https://serialweedkiller.netlify.com/weeds/ambrosia-artemesiifolia/).

## Seeds

**6º Identification tip:** seeds have straw coloring, black and moss, have a peculiar characteristic looking like a head with a small crown and a pointed hat, have to be careful not to confuse with the seed of [*Ambrosia artemisiifolia* Common ragweed](https://serialweedkiller.netlify.com/weeds/ambrosia-artemesiifolia/), this has the crown and hat much smaller.

**7º Identification tip:** seedlings  have oval cotyledons/spatulas or with thin tips, the first true leaf is that facilitates identification because it already presents the deep lobes dividing the blade limbus.
