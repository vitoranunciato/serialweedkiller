## Identification tips

![general](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/weeds/amaranthus%20retroflexus/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** the name of the amaranth genus comes from the Greek amaranths, "unbeatable", referring to the long-lasting flowers. Just remember who this species is "sister", the [Amaranthus palmeri](https://serialweedkiller.netlify.com/pt/weeds/amaranthus-palmeri/) so just remember the Chuck Norris  (unbeatable), because of these days the [A. palmeri](https://serialweedkiller.netlify.com/pt/weeds/amaranthus-palmeri/) is the  Chuck Norris of the weeds. Now, retroflexus is difficult to make a joke and associate the name, because the translation would bend or turn back.

## Plant shape

**2nd Identification Tip:** this species is almost iqual to the [A. palmeri](https://serialweedkiller.netlify.com/pt/weeds/amaranthus-palmeri/), follow the hair to separete them.

## Leaves

**3º Identification tip:** leaves are alternated on the stem, with long stems and range from opaque green to bright or reddish-green. The blade of the sheet is oval or diamond-shaped but is usually wider at the base. The edges of the leaves are smooth. The tips of the leaves are pointed or sometimes slightly notched. The lower surface of each leaf is usually pubescent, while the upper surface is less pubescent or hairless.

## Stem

**4º Identification tip:** the central stem is robust, round, light green and more or less **covered with white hair**; it also has thin white longitudinal veins, thick and smooth bottom, usually rough upper, with short, dense hair, greenish to slightly reddish, but usually red near the roots.

## Flowers

**5º Identification tip:** the flowers are small, green and piled up in thick and rough thorns at the top of the plant, smaller than the inflorescences of [A. palmeri](https://serialweedkiller.netlify.com/pt/weeds/amaranthus-palmeri/). Smaller clusters are located in the underarms of the leaves.

## Seeds

**6º Identification tip:** it is almost not possible to identify the seeds among the genus amaranthus, so it is worth checking, small, black and shiny seeds. If you feel brave and confident you could try to identify the seeds [here](http://idtools.org/id/table_grape/weed-tool/key/GrapeSeedKey/Media/Html/fact_sheets/Ama-ret.html)

## Roots

**7º Identification tip:** quite striking feature is the red coloring of the root, which helps a lot of in the identification.

## Seedlings - the terror of all
