![geral](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/weeds/arctium%20minus/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** the name of the genus comes from the Greek arktos, bear, perhaps alluding to seed wrappers resembling a bear,  minus comes from Latin, which means less.

## Plant shape

**2º Identification tip:** biennial plant that produces a basal rosette of large leaves in the first year, and in the second year the plant grows a lot in height, producing several branches and at the tips of the branches is produced the flowers and the pods that gives the species its name.
