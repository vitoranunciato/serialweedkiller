## Identification tips

![geral](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/post/capsella%20bursa-pastoris/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** The name of the genus Capsella  comes from the Latin "little box", and the name of the species,  bursa-pastoris means shepherd's purse, these names are associated with the plant's seed capsule that looks like a sheep shepherd's pouch. How do I know what a pasture bag looks like!? I have no idea, but take a look at the image bellow, in fact the common name of the plant is also shepherd's  purse."

## Plant shape

**2º Identification tip:** it has its initial development in rosette, presenting stems that protrude from the rosette, this  characteristic is seen in almost all plants of the mustard family.

## Leaves

**3º Identification tip:** the leaves are not the best parameter  for identification because they can vary greatly, and can be more or less lobed (openings in the leaves,  appearance  of saw), usually the leaves of the rosette are the largest leaves and more concentrated, the leaves of the stems are thin and much smaller than the leaves of the rosette.
Usually the older leaves are rounder, but it is not the rule.

## Stem

**4º Identification tip:** the stems are upright, green to purple, have hair. Plants are usually have few stems, the leaves of the stems are well spaced and are sessile. The stems always end with a raceme of flowers.
