## Identification tips

![general](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/post/solanum%20rostratum/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** Solanum  is Latin for "calming down", in reference to the narcotic properties of some species, while  rostratum  means "beak, snout or beak". I like to associate the [style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigma_(botany))of the flower with a birdbeak,  also remember  that the  buffalo always has a  bird eating its ticks.
