## Identification tips

![geral](https://github.com/vitoranunciato/academic-kickstart/blob/master/content/pt/post/xanthium%20strumarium/image/geral.jpg?raw=true)

**Tip #1:** xanthos comes from Greek, yellow and stanza means "cushion as swelling" in reference to seed pods. I confess that the name is not too difficult to make yellow pad analogy, but the image I did got very bad ๐ญ.

## Leaves

**3ยบ Identification tip:** alternating sheets. They are heart-shaped, with well rounded bases and wide tips. Its toothed margins, while the upper surface has a sandpaper texture. Each leaf has a long petiole, usually reddish green or reddish they usually have short white hairs.

## Flowers

**5ยบ Identification tip:** the flowers are given in racemes each set of flowers develops from the armpit of each upper leaf. In addition, the central stem ends in a raceme, similar to the racemes of the underarms of the leaves. Because the common Cocklebur is monoic, each racemo produces several male composite flowers along the upper half, while several female composite flowers occur in the lower half.

## Seeds

**6ยบ Identification tip:** the seeds are large and are involved in the capsules being difficult to separate, so the identification is given by the capsule.

## Capsula

**7ยบ Identification tip:** the capsule is called bur, it is ovoid, green, turning yellow and then brown in axillary curls with stems. Each bur has two strong, curved or straight horns and is covered with hook-shaped spines.
