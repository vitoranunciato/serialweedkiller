## Identification tips

**Tip #1:** Unfortunately this has no trick to decorate the scientific name, sinapis is "mustard" in Greek and arvensis is "from the field" in Latin.

## Plant shape

**2º Identification tip:** it tends to have large leaves near the ground and the stem and branches tend to be more prominent and have smaller leaves.

## Leaves

**3º Identification tip:** leaves are not a good identification parameter, because they have two types of leaves in the same plant, not counting cotyledon. One of them is very similar to the other brassicas, being composed of a long petiole and central rib quite detached. The other type of leaf is quite wide, both types of leaves can present a very intense dark green and rough appearance.

## Stem

**4º Identification tip:** the stems are fundamental for identification, a unique feature of wild mustard is a purple/reddish spot/ring in the connection of the stem with the new branches, facilitating identification when the plant is more developed.

**It is also worth noting that the stems have many hairs and large. When older they lose the characteristic stain mentioned above.**

## Flowers

**5º Identification tip:** flowers also help in identification, are mustard yellow and have 4 petals, are the largest flowers among the different types of mustard and plants that can confuse in identification.

## Seeds
**6º Identification tip:** the seeds are quite spherical and have different coloration and can be reddish, black passing between lead and gray. They're small.

## Pod
**7º Identification tip:** wild mustard has pods from the flowers where the seeds are stored, the pods are green and pass into the straw as they age. The formation of the pods occurs gradually, so in the same branch can have large pods, small and flowers ascending.

## Seedlings - the terror of all

**8º Identification tip:** cotyledon is reniform (kidney format) the true leaves are already of the normal format.
