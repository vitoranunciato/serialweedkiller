title: GR Volunteer Corn Control with mixture of Clethodim and Dicamba 
event: NCWSS 75th Annual Meeting â€“ Virtual
event_url: http://ncwss.org/
location: Online
summary: Evaluate the effects of Clethodim and Dicamba tank-mixture on GRVC control (F1 generation) at different heights, with and without the use of non-ionic surfactant (NIS).
abstract: Volunteer corn is often a recurrent weed infesting RR soybean fields. The control of volunteer corn is usually based on the application of ACCase inhibitors, where good control is often achieved in post-emergence applications. However, the antagonistic interactions between ACCase inhibitors and growth regulators tank-mixtures are well reported in the literature. This issue is relevant considering the widespread adoption of dicamba-tolerant soybean in the US, where clethodim + dicamba tank-mixture applications are a common practice among farmers.
