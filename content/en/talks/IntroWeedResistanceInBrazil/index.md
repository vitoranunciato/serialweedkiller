location: Online
summary: Herbicide resistance is a plant's ability to survive and reproduce after exposure to a previously lethal dose of a herbicide.
abstract: Among the modern techniques used in agriculture, chemical control by means of herbicides is the most effective and economically viable method, especially in large areas of cultivation. However, its indiscriminate use has led to a very rapid evolution in cases of resistance to these chemicals, in addition to problems related to low susceptibility species.
